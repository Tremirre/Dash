This dashboard is based on manually collected data and the correctness of this data is not guaranteed. The data were written down from the declarations of assets of deputies and other data provided on the official website of the Sejm. The data regarding financial standing of representatives were taken from 2021 as they were the most up-to-date at the time we started making this dashboard. The general data about representatives have been scraped from the gov page, hence they are very much up-to-date.
